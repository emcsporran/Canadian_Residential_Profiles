# Canadian_Residential_Profiles
This is repository contains analysis and modificaitons to openly available Canadian residential data, through the Carleton University [Sustainable Building Energy Systems](https://carleton.ca/sbes/) (SBES) group. The goal is to perform statistical analysis and aggregation to generate generic residential load profiles based on several factors.

## Reasoning
Canada is an environement that sees weather extremes and variation, even within its' own borders. However, it is challenging to find residential load data that has detailed precision (time < 15mins), and covers a whole year. The significnance of this as an application is that to increase the efficiency of households in a canadaian setting, it is important to be able to test/reference accurate canadian data. Canadian households typically use combinations of air conditioning (AC), and heating units (HU), as well as many other thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs). This is because during the summer temperatures can reach mid-high 30s Celsius region-depending, and in the winter temperatures can be consistently aroun -25 to -35 Celsius, in the more populated regions, region-depending.

## Resources
The SBES group has managed to collect annual data sets with granularity of 1 minute, from 23 houses overall, though they were done in 2 batches of 12 houses in 2009-2010, and 11 houses in 2011-2012.
